# ExploitDB-dorks-scraping

In this project we extract all the dorks from google-hacking database (https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) and store them in a database file 
named 'ghdb'. We can use the function lookup_dork to then search through the database and return all the dorks that contain a given keyword. Another function to search on google for specific dorks that contain a keyword and extract them is going to be implemented
